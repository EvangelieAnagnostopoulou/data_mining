    <h2>Multi-source Big Data Fusion Driven Proactivity for Intelligent Mobility</h2>
    <h6>The EU-funded OPTIMUM project is working to unveil state-of-the-art information technology solutions
            to improve transit, freight transportation and traffic connectivity throughout Europe. Through tailor-made
            applications, OPTIMUM is striving to bring proactive and problem-free mobility to modern transport systems
            by introducing and promoting interoperability, adaptability and dynamicity.</h6>
    <h3 class="center">Background</h3>
    <h6>The transportation sector is undergoing considerable transformation with seamless connectivity and ever-increasing
            mobility options. Modern transportation systems have to mitigate problems emerging from complex mobility
            environments and the intensive use of transport networks, such as excessive CO2 emissions, high congestion
            levels and diminished quality of life. Due to the saturation and complexity of transport networks, innovative
            solutions to these problems need to be underpinned by collected, processed and broadcasted data from various
            sensors, systems, crowdsourcing and service providers. Furthermore, digital-age transport systems will have to
            anticipate situations in near real time and provide the means for proactive decisions, which, in turn, will
            prevent problems before they emerge.</h6>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul class="center">
        <li>
            Highlighting and demonstrating the benefits and potentials of big data fusion and proactive behaviour in the diverse
            and multi-modal transportation context by designing a distributed and scalable architecture for its efficient realization.
        </li>
        <li>
                To enable comprehensive observing of the transport ecosystem, by designing and developing a smart sensing system able
                to cope with a huge amount of heterogeneous data in real-time
        </li>
        <li>To enable semantic understanding of acquired data in near real time by designing and developing an efficient management
                framework for dynamic (proactive) and context-aware anticipation and detection of the situations of interest on the basis
                of complex and predictive data analysis algorithms and event-detection</li>
        <li>
                To support proactive decisions and sustainable transportation behaviours through proactive information provisioning and
                personalization, persuasive mechanisms, including novel incentive schemes, for behavioural changes and real time multimodal
                routing and navigation algorithms
        </li>
        <li>
                To extend existing forecasting models by integrating Traveller2Traveller (T2T) and crowd sourcing behavioural interactions
        </li>
    </ul>
